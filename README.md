<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
Your full-stack application must meet the following technical requirements:

- Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
- Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
- Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
- Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.
- Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social login) and authorization (logged-in users can do additional things).
- Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
- Have at least 2 commits per day that you worked on.
- Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.
- Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
- As a final step, check all the features outlined in points 1 - 5 and ensure they are implemented and working ahead of delivery.


<h2>Deliverables</h2>
Students must submit the following deliverables in order for the project to be deemed complete:

- A working app that meets all technical requirements, built by you.
- A working app deployed on Fly.io/Netlify.
- The two URLs of your GitHub repositories (frontend and backend).
- The URL to the deployed React app.
- The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
- Your GitHub repos must have a README with the completed project documentation.
- Present and demo your app during the Final Project presentations.
